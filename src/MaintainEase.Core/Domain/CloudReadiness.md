# Cloud Readiness Guidelines for Domain Layer

## Immutable Entities
- Entities should be designed to be immutable after creation
- Use constructors for initial state and methods for state transitions
- Avoid setters for properties, use private setters only
- Use value objects for complex properties

## Serialization Strategies
- All domain entities should be serializable
- Use JSON-friendly property types
- Avoid circular references
- Include ID properties in serialized output
- Plan for versioning of serialized entities

## Eventual Consistency
- Design domain services to handle eventual consistency scenarios
- Use idempotent operations wherever possible
- Implement optimistic concurrency control
- Use domain events for asynchronous updates
- Design aggregates to maintain consistency boundaries

## Idempotent Operations
- Ensure all domain operations can be safely repeated
- Use unique operation IDs for tracking
- Check for existence before creation
- Implement appropriate locking mechanisms
- Design state transitions to be idempotent

## Event Sourcing Compatibility
- Use domain events to track all state changes
- Ensure events contain enough information to reconstruct state
- Design entities to be rebuildable from event stream
- Keep events immutable and versioned
- Store events in a durable store

## Distributed Services
- Design domain services to be stateless
- Use dependency injection for all external dependencies
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Use the outbox pattern for reliable event publishing
- Document service dependencies clearly

## Service Discovery
- Design services to be registered with service discovery
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document service capabilities and contracts
- Implement health check endpoints
- Support graceful degradation when services are unavailable
